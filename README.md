Recursion is a programming technique in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem. In essence, recursion involves solving a problem by breaking it down into smaller instances of the same problem. Each smaller instance is solved recursively until a base case is reached, at which point the recursion stops and the solutions to the smaller instances are combined to solve the original problem.

In this repository you will find different concept and code which I have implemented using concept of recursion in Java such as Searching & Sorting Algorithm using recursion, coding question such as Find sum of digit, Fibonacci series, Reverse Number, etc. using recursion
